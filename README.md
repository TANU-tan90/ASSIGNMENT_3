This project demonstrates how a complete terminal-based game can be built using only basic C programming concepts, making it perfect for beginners.
Each board position is stored as a separate variable (char a, b, c ...) instead of arrays, and all logic is handled with if-else conditions and loops.

In addition to simplicity, this version includes beautiful color output, making the game more engaging and fun to play directly in the terminal.
